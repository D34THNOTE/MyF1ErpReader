1. In the EgoErpArchiver project the MainViewModel is kind of where it all starts. There is a method there called "Open" which
calls the methods named .LoadData() of classes like XmlFilesWorkspaceViewModel

2. After reading it, the XML file is stored in XmlFilesWorkspace, which has an instance in MainViewModel, as the first element of a list:
MainViewModel.XmlFilesWorkspace.XmlFiles[0]

We need to format the bytes into actual, readable data, and we have the XML content ready(as a string):
            var readXmlFile = MainViewModel.XmlFilesWorkspace.XmlFiles[0];

            ErpFragment fragment = readXmlFile.Fragment;

            byte[] data = fragment.GetDataArray(decompress: true);
            string xmlContent = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(data);

            return xmlContent;
