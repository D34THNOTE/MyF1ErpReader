The README of the original project can be found [here](https://github.com/EgoEngineModding/Ego-Engine-Modding/tree/master), I am only utilizing its library, dependencies and parts of EgoErpArchiver project from it

The goal of my project, which I creatively called "MyF1ErpReader" is to deliver a console app to which the user can pass a path to a .erp file and an output path. The expected behavior generates an Excel file with various information read from the .erp file and put into Excel, together with color scale formatting.

The type of information the app is trying to generate: Temperature windows for optimal tyre operation for both inside and outside of the tyres, "objective" grip of each tyre(i.e. you can see exactly when C5, softest, compound is overtaken in the grip it provides by harder equivalents) and tyre degradation presented in percentage - calculated assuming each tyre has 100% grip at 0% wear
